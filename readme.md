This is a collection of programs I have made during my work as a researcher in complex dynamics in one variable.
A colleague asked me to make them available so that they could be used (or maybe built upon?) by other.
So here there are.
They are mostly in Python/Cython.

They might need a bit of tinkering to make them work fine.

# Arnold Tongues

For drawing images related to the dynamics on the circle. Requires configparer, NumPy and Cython.
