This is a collection of programs I have made during my work as a researcher in complex dynamics in one variable.
A colleague asked me to make them available so that they could be used (or maybe built upon?) by other.
So here there are.
They are mostly in Python/Cython.

They might need a bit of tinkering to make them work fine.

# Arnold Tongues

For drawing images related to the dynamics on the circle. Requires configparer, NumPy and Cython. 

See [arnold-tongues.md](./arnold-tongues.md).

# Transcendental Maps

For drawing pictures related to the dynamics of holomorphic maps, in particular linearizers/Poincar&eacute; maps and inverse of Fatou coordinates.

This program has not been curated yet. This is work in progress.
